1.  Write a Python program to handle a ZeroDivisionError exception when dividing a number by zero.
2.	Write a Python program that opens a file and handles a FileNotFoundError exception if the file does not exist
3. 	Write a Python program to create a person class. Include attributes  like name, country and date of birth. Implement a method to  determine the personâ€™s age. 
4.	Create a Bus class that inherits from the Vehicle class.
5.	create a class with constructor.
6.	create a class with method.
7.	Write a function that returns Factorial of a number.Get the input from user.
	example:	Input:Enter a number = 6
				Expected output:Factorial is 720
8. Write a function to find out length of a string without using inbuilt(len) function.
9. Write a Python function to calculate_average that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the average of those numbers. Your function should work for any list of numbers, and it should return the average as a floating-point number. You can assume that the input list will not be empty.
	For example, if you call calculate_average([10, 20, 30, 40, 50]), the function should return 30.0 as the average of these numbers.
